<h2>Electronics</h2>
<br>
<p>In this module, we learn the basics of electronics. 
<p>Electronics consist of...
<br> Voltage, measured in volts
<br> Current, measured in Amps
<br> Resistance, measured in Ohms</p><br>
<br>
Common electrical components <br>
- Switches: usually the connector and breaker of a circuit. A common type is a tactile switch. Used regularly in this module.
<br> - Wires: Usually made up of copper with insulator on the outside
<br> - Resistors: made to have a fixed resistance to current
<br>
<h3>Breadboard and UNO board (Aurdino)</h3>
<p>Aurdino: An Arduino System comprises of Software & Software Tools including : Integrated Development System (IDE), Arduino programming language (C++ like), Development & Debugging tool and Software libraries (open source contributions).

<br> Breadboard: refers to a (usually) solder-free, plug-and-play platform allowing for speedy insertion and removal of electrical components in circuit-building applications.

<h3> Assignments </h3>
UNO switch with LEDs,     as you can see below, we have 4 LEDs in a circuit broken and connected by a tactile switch. With the code, the button allows different LEDs to turn on at once. The input is the switch and the output are the 4 LEDs. These are all tested using the platform TinkerCAD. You can make circuits on the site to test out before doing.
<br>

<br><br><br>
Here is another circuit using the Potentiometer. It allows us to control the brightness of the LED. The input is the Potentiometer and output the LED.

<br><br>
This is my friend and I applying the circuit tested in TinkerCAD to a real breadboard and UNO board. 
<br>

<br> We made use of a 555 to create an itegrated circuit with an LED.

<br> This is the final working circuit.

<h3> Soldering </h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qps9woUGkvI">This</a> is a useful and good video reference to learn the basics of soldering. 
	<br> Soldering ismostly used in electronics, metalwork, etc. It joins two or more items by melting and putting a filler metal (solder) into the joint. 
	<br>
<img src="elect15.png" width="400" style="margin: auto;">
<br> These are the tools that are needed:
<br> - solder iron
<br> - brass sponge 
<br> - wet sponge
<br> - safety googles
<br> - solder
<br> - it is optional to have a clamp but it is helpful
<br><br><br>
</p>
<h4>applying it practically</h4>
<p> 
<img src="elect5.png" width="300" style="margin: auto;">
<br> First we dipped the soldering iron in flux. Flux is a chemical cleaning agent. Flux also protects the metal surfaces from re-oxidisation during soldering. It is used before and after soldering.
<br><br>
<img src="elect6.png" width="300" style="margin: auto;">
<br> Here we melt the solder to use (make sure you clean the iron before this). Apply the heat and solder to the surface. 
<br><br>
<img src="elect7.png" width="300" style="margin: auto;"><img src="elect3.png" width="300" style="margin: auto;">
<br> In this case, we were soldering a wire to a clasp. (to do this we had to strip the wire first as seen on the right).
<br><br>

<br> Here is our end product.

<br><br>
<p>Thank you! That's all :)</p>
