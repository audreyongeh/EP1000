				<h2>1. Research</h2>
				<p>These are some ideas I wanted to work on/got inspired by. I use the site <a herf="https://www.instructables.com/">Instructables</a> to find inspiration. Many people who have done a variety of projects upload their works there. I'm interested in making a light that has a sensor, such that when you place your hand on it, it lights up.</p>
<br>
<p>
Inspo 1: <a herf="https://www.instructables.com/Eclipse-Lamp/">Eclipse Lamp</a>
<br>
An eclipse lamp seemed like a cool way to turn on a light. I thought the prototyping process for the gears and points where the lights turn on and off would be interesting to play around with.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Inspo 2: <a herf="https://www.instructables.com/Mood-Lamp-1/">Mood Lamp</a>
<br>
Was highly considering this, but I was wondering if it was possible to do it as a mini “streetlamp” instead. This tutorial in particular made use of a recycled lamp, electronics are also not included.
</p>
<br>
<p>After some research, it was clear to me my design mind was getting to me, I needed to look more for the functionalities and electronics of the project rather than the designs. So I started researching electronics on using sensors to turn on a light inside a lamp. This is what I found.</p>
<br>
Tutorial 1: <a herf="https://www.instructables.com/Light-Sensor-Photoresistor-Arduino-Tinkercad/">Light Sensor (Photoresistor)</a>
<br>
This tutorial was done using Arduino in Tinkercad.

Tutorial 2: <a herf="https://www.instructables.com/Light-Sensor-With-Arduino/">Another Light Sensor with Arduino</a>
I am more inclined to using this tutorial as I feel it would fit better with the project I am planning to do. I also felt that it was simpler. Being a beginner, I felt this would be a safe route to go.
Regardless, these are my two options.
<br>
<br>
I also settled on the tutorial I wanted to follow for my lamp.
Right <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Hidden-Silhouette-Lamp/">here</a>
<br>
This is a silhoutte lamp. Depending on the way you choose to cut an image, a shape will be projected on the box when the light is turned on. I intend to make a silhoutte lamp that turns on when you place your hand on it.

<h3>These are some things I need</h3>
<p>
UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!

<p>Thank you! That's all :)</p>
