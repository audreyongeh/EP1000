				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Project</h2>
				
				<h2>1. Research</h2>
				<p>These are some ideas I wanted to work on/got inspired by. I use the site Instructables. to find inspiration. Many people who have done a variety of projects upload their works there. I'm interested in making a light that has a sensor, such that when you place your hand on it, it lights up.</p>
<br>
<p>
I also settled on the tutorial I wanted to follow for my lamp.
Right <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Hidden-Silhouette-Lamp/">here</a>
<br>
This is a silhoutte lamp. Depending on the way you choose to cut an image, a shape will be projected on the box when the light is turned on. I intend to make a silhoutte lamp that turns on when you place your hand on it. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>These are some things I need</h3>
<p>
3ply wood
<br>
switch
<br>
Ardino UNO board
