				<h3>EP1000 Digital Fabrication & Prototyping</h3>
				<br>
				<p>This is an elective module offered to Singapore Polytechnic students as part of their diploma course. It covers how to use Digital Fabrication techniques in designing and creating prototypes. Through this module we are introduced to design thinking concepts as we think through and consider how to design and make functional prototypes. We will also use Computer Aided Design techniques, 3D printing and laser cutting methods to develop the prototype. Additionally, we will use a microcontroller to add intelligence to our project. 
				<br>
				<br>
In that process, we learn how to document and publish our work. This site was created to fulfil precisely that. In this site, my learning and thinking is documented and published for you- the viewers- to see, read and potentially learn from.
