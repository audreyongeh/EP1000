				<h3>1. Research</h3>
				<br>
				<p>I had to make a prototype for a phone stand. To do that, I needed to look through some research. In class, my classmates and I did a google search for phone stands. These were the things that stood out to us.</p>

				<p>I drew this together with my classmates. It was the first draft. We had difficulty trying to figure out the perspective and had to re-draw it twice. This is the second one where we managed to identify three different parts to make and what each part should probably look like.

Here is a more detailed drawing of each part, itâ€™s dimensions and where its slits are supposed to go. I made this to get a more precise prototype later on. I realised the importance of having specific measurements and making sure it coincides with the other pieces. Without precise measuring and consideration, the prototype would not fit and ultimately be a fail. </p>
				<br>
				<h2>Prototyping Process</h2>

<p>While cutting it out, I ran into a few problems. First was my precision in cutting and sharpness of the blade. I did not expect the cardboard to be so thick yet soft. I realised that you have to accept that while you trail and error, you are bound to make some inaccurate/messy cuts (such as the ones below)</p>

PIC

<p>My main realisation while making this prototype is that I had misjudged the slots at the back. These slots were intended to be for adjustment sake. However, I did not take into account how far back this would make the stand as well as how thick each slot would be (I had only drawn lines).</p>

PIC

<p>Another problem I ran into was that the phone did not have any grip from the front hence it kept sliding down. This is not something I caught in the ideation process as well as my discussion with my classmates. Hence, it was a good discovery and realisation when testing this prototype.

This is the video of the prototype, as you can see I struggled a fair bit to make it stand. I kept this in the video to show how I need to make an improvement to it. </p>
