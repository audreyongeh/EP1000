<h2>3D Printing</h2>

<p>3D Printing is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a digital model. It is best for rapid prototyping such as for mockups for clients, planning a product, displaying and interacting with an idea, the list goes on. 
<br>
Several materials a 3D printer uses are:
<br>
<br>
FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) = filament is heated and deposited layer by layer
<br>
SLS (Selective Layer Sintering) = makes use of a laser to fuse powdered material at different points of the structure/model
<br>
SLA (Stereolithography) = goes through a photochemical process - light is used to harden each layer
<br>
Different materials will affect print speeds, stength, accuracy, etc.

<h3>1. Ultimaker Cura </h3>
<p>Ultimaker Cura is an open source slicing application for 3D printers. It is free to download to use. It will allow us to slice (in a sense, render) designs in Fusion 360 to get it printed. There are other softwares that allow us to do the same thing such as...
	<br>
Meshmixer.
<br>
Repetier-Host.
<br>
Tinkercad.
<br>
Blender.
<br>
OctoPrint.
<br>
Onshape.
<br>
Simplify3D.
<br>
However we use Ultimaker Cura due to the 3D printers we have in FabLab (Ultimaker models).</p>

<h3>2. 3d Printers</h3>
<p>These are the models available in SP.

<h3>3. Things to consider in a 3D print (not exhaustive)</h3>
<h4>1. infills.</h4>

<p>

<p>There are different files that are compatible. First, you need to convert from CAD design to STL file. This is after making your CAD object to a 3D print. (under Tools>Make>3D print)</p>

<p>This is my gcode file, you can download/look at it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VcROlMt1Xqn5wYBt4HgsMFcdy_GBZF4-/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<h4>2. wall thickness.</h4>
<p>The finer the print is and the thinner the layers, the longer it will take to print.</p>

<h4>3. support structures</h4>
<p>Support structures are additional removable 3D parts to support 'floating' parts of the print. This allows the suspended areas of the print to be printed out.</p>
